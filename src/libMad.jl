# MadNLP Solver interface definition
# First define the possible types that any given `::Type` option can take.
# This is important as it allows `--trim` to be smart about what types to keep
# TODO(@anton): trim is currently broken so this is some complexity for little gain
#               however in future this gain will likely be _large_.
